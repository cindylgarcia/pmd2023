## DrupalEasy Professional Module Development Course

In January 2023 I took the Professional Module Development Couse with Mike Anello from [DrupalEasy](https://www.drupaleasy.com/). The course was 16 weeks long and consisted of building several modules that allowed us to build a Drupal site that allows users to create nodes related to remote Git repositories. The goal of the course was to teach students best practices related to Drupal module development in a manner that allows them to take on the role of a Drupal back-end developer for their organization. The course was designed for people with an introductory level of knowledge of Drupal module development. The instructor provides a repo of the code used in this course for his students to stay in sync with the rest of the class. This is the class repo with my settings for a MaCos using DDEV, Composer, PHP, Drupal 10. 

## Custom and Core Modules Used
